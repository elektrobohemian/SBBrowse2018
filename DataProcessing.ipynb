    "## Why to Read this Tutorial?\n",
    "* In this tutorial, you will learn to read metadata from an OAI-PMH data provider and how to convert the retrieved data from Dublin Core to a pandas data frame.\n",
    "* Furthermore, you will carry out some basic data analysis on your data in order to find out if the data is corrupt or unclean. Based on an example, you will clean some aspects of your data.\n",
    "* Finally, you will analyse and visualize the data with the help of a network graph.\n",

    "The following code snippet initializes your Python run-time enviroment in order to run all of the subsequent actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed everything correctly with the help of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as explained in [dst4l0.ipynb](https://github.com/elektrobohemian/dst4l-copenhagen/blob/master/dst4l0.ipynb), the following packages should be installed correctly and be importable without problems."
